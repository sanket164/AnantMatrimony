                            All payments made in Indian Rupees will follow an Auto renewal service. This automatic
                            renewal shall extend to all members residing or holding domicile outside the territory
                            of India who have paid by credit card. Members who do not wish for auto extension
                            can also turn OFF their Auto renewal status by clicking on the "Member Subscription"
                            link in the "My Anantmatrimony.com"page.However members cannot turn Auto renewal
                            OFF 1 day before expiry date while the Auto renewal process is on.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            The advantages of Auto renewal are that it allows a member to continuously use the
                            paid services without having to worry about expiry period. So if in case a member
                            forgets to renew the membership, Auto renewal service will automatically renew the
                            membership.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            In situations where the Auto renewal status is OFF and at the end of the expiry
                            period a member forgets to renew the membership, the paid service will be discontinued
                            and the member will lose all the benefits and privileges allotted to Paid Members,
                            which is:</p>
                <ul>
                            <li>View contact information of members who have contacted them</li>
                            <li>Send Personalised Messages</li>
                            <li>View members contact information including Verified Phone Numbers</li>
                            <li>Maintain privacy control</li>

                        </ul>
                <p>
                            If a member has upgraded the membership using Auto renewal and then decides to cancel
                            the membership, it can be done. But to get a refund the member must not have used
                            any of our services and cancellation must be done within 7 days of renewal.
                        </p>

                            the membership.
